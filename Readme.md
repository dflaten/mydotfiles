# My Dotfiles Usage Instructions

1. On a new computer, start by running install script before anything else to
   get symlinks in place. (This will make things like nvim a bit awkward for a
   bit). 
1. To get `nvim` working correctly do a `:PlugInstall` after you have run the
   script to get the plugins working correctly.
1. To get pyright language server working correctly in nvim install with this command:
   `npm i -g pyright`. If any issues follow instructions
   [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) to get it installed.
1. I use `InputMonoCondenced` for my terminal font. Look
   [here](https://input.djr.com/download/) to get it.
